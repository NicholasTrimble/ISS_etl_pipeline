ISS ETL Pipeline

This project tracks the International Space Station (ISS) by fetching its position from an API, checking if it is overhead and if itâ€™s night at a given location, and storing the data in a SQLite database. It runs automatically every 10 minutes and includes a Flask web dashboard to view the latest entries.

How to use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the ETL pipeline: python Main.py

Open the dashboard in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Go to /data to see the latest ISS entries.
